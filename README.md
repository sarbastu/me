## About Me

I’m someone who loves creating responsive and dynamic apps. General focus on delivering excellent user experiences and implementing efficient, scalable solutions. I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring design patterns, and mastering algorithms. My favourite things to code are interactivity and animations!

## Insights and Afterthoughts

Working on this project helped me understand a lot more about design concepts. On a higher level, learning more about typography concepts and color theory was very interesting. I especially gained an appreciation for design tokens, which significantly reduced media queries and allowed for quick modifications. I also gained a lot of confidence in my ability to animate and transform elements, although I may have gone a bit overboard with the effects (no regrets)!

On the scripting side, it was fun overengineering what could have been some very simple, rigid functions. I decided to use class composition with an event-emitter system and a hierarchical update structure similar to what you would see in Unity. It took significantly more time to make what was essentially the same functionality I had initially with two overbloated classes, but the experience alone was worth it, and I did learn a lot more than I would have otherwise.
